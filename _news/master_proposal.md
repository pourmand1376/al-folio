Proposal Title: Real-time automatic detection and classification of colorectal
polyps during colonoscopy using Explainable AI

***

This study aims to develop an AI system for real-time detection and classification of colorectal polyps during colonoscopy. The system utilizes a validated deep-learning AI polyp detection software and is trained using a combination of public annotated datasets and a national dataset of static images taken and labeled by experienced endoscopists. The goal is to improve the accuracy and reliability of polyp detection and differentiation, reducing the number of unnecessary surgeries and their associated negative consequences, including complications, increased workload for doctors, and increased medical costs. The use of Explainable AI in this study allows for greater transparency and understanding of the decision-making process, enhancing the trust and confidence in the results of the AI system.

Differentiating polyps is crucial in colonoscopy because it can help ensure that only the necessary surgeries are performed. For example, if a polyp is small (less than 5mm) and non-cancerous, there is no need to remove it. On the other hand, if a polyp is large or cancerous, it must be removed. By accurately identifying and differentiating polyps during colonoscopy, we can avoid performing unnecessary surgeries, which can have many negative consequences.

Unnecessary surgeries can lead to complications such as bleeding, infection, and perforation of the colon. These complications can cause discomfort and even require additional treatment, which can be costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, unnecessary surgeries increase the workload for doctors, who already have a heavy workload, and can lead to burnout. Additionally, medical costs can increase significantly due to the cost of the surgery, the cost of post-operative care, and the cost of treating any complications that may arise.

Therefore, the development of an AI system to accurately identify and differentiate polyps during colonoscopy is of great importance. A prospective, multi-center study using a validated deep-learning AI polyp detection software and national datasets can help ensure that this AI system is accurate and reliable. The ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes and reduce the negative consequences associated with unnecessary surgeries in colonoscopy.
