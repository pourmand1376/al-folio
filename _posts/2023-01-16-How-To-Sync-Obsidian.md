# Introduction
I've tried many tools and tutorials to sync my obsidian notes between android and windows. They all have the same problems:
1. Some need subscription service (Obsidian Sync) which I'm not willing to pay
2. Some can't handle editing the same file (Sync via GoogleDrive, Dropbox and ...)
3. Others need complicated setup and maintanance. 

# My Solution
This solution takes about 30 minutes to setup. But, once it is finished, it workes perfectly. 

## Initial Setup
1. Create a Github or Gitlab Repository (Make sure it is `private`)
2. Clone your repository to a place in your computer
3. Open that folder as a vault in obsidian
4. You can also move your current obsidian notes to this folder (in case you have any).

## Sync Windows and Mac
For windows and mac, you can just install `obsidian-git` plugin. Installing that would be a breeze. Just make sure to set automatic pull and push (I've set it to 5 minutes). 

I've pinned these three commands since sometimes I want to instantly sync my changes. 
Obsidian > Options > Command Pallete > Pinned Commands

- Obsidian Git: Commit all changes
- Obsidian Git: Push
- Obsidian Git: Pull

### Extra Option for windows users
 Note that if you are using windows, you should also use this command to prevent path error on odd filenames ([+](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63727594))
```
git config core.protectNTFS false
```

## Automatic Merging
Sometimes you may change the same file. I know it is rare but it is possible. We prevent conflict by two ways (gitignore and gitattributes).

These files need to be created at the root of your directory (where `.git` folder resides).
```
touch .gitignore
touch .gitattributes
```
First, You should add these lines to `.gitignore`:
```
.trash/
.obsidian/workspace
.obsidian/workspace.json
.obsidian/workspace-mobile.json
.obsidian/app.json
```
This tells git to ignore certain files that are likely to cause conflicts, like recently opened files.

Next, you'll add the `.gitattributes` file and tell git how to handle merging for specific file types. For example, you can tell git to treat markdown files as regular text files and merge them accordingly:
```
*.md merge=union
```
What this does is it instructs git to merge markdown files as if they were plain text. This way, the only time you'll get conflicts is when you change the same line in both files, which is pretty unlikely.

## Sync Android
For this part, I used [this tutorial](https://gist.github.com/Makeshift/43c7ecb3f1c28a623ea4386552712114) for the most part: 
To Use Git on Android:
- First, you'll need to download and install the Termux app from the Google Play Store ([Termux â€“ Apps on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux&hl=en_GB&gl=US)). Once you have it installed, open the app and run the following commands 
```
apt update
apt upgrade -y
pkg install openssh -y
pkg install git -y
termux-setup-storage
```
These commands will update your Termux installation, install the necessary packages for Git, and set up your storage so you can access your files.
- Next, you'll need to add your Git configurations. Run the following commands:
```
git config --global credential.helper store
git config --global user.email "<your_email>"
git config --global user.name "<The name you want on your commits>"
```
Replace `<your_email>` and `<The name you want on your commits>` with your own information.

- Now you're ready to clone a repository. Use the following command:
```
# go to the path in your shared folder
cd cd /storage/emulated/0/shared/
mkdir obsidian
git clone <your repository_github_url>
git config --global --add safe.directory <repo-path>
```
For Authentication, you have two ways. Use [Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token), or use [SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh). I use the second as the first one is blocked in my country. 

You should now have the repository folder on your device and you should be able to open your obsidian files inside its app.

But This is not the end. We want to be able to sync obsidian. Right?

The first step is to add a `.profile` file to your Termux home directory. To do this, run the following commands:
```
cd ~
touch .profile
```
Next, you'll need to add some lines of code to your `.profile` file. These lines will create a function called `sync_obsidian` that will take care of syncing your notes. You should add the following code:
```bash
function sync_obsidian
{
cd /storage/emulated/0/shared/obsidian/<your-repo-name>
git add .
git commit -m "Android Commit"
git fetch
git merge --no-edit
git add .
git commit -m "automerge android"
git push
}
alias ob="sync_obsidian"
alias o="sync_obsidian && exit"
```
Make sure to replace `/storage/emulated/0/shared/obsidian-notes` with the location of your obsidian-notes folder.

The `alias ob="sync_obsidian"` creates an alias `ob` for the function `sync_obsidian`, so that you can call the function by just typing `ob` in the terminal. The `alias o="sync_obsidian && exit"` creates an alias `o` for the function `sync_obsidian` and also exits the terminal after syncing. 

> It's important not to use `git pull` in `sync_obsidian` function since it will prompt you for a merge commit message every time there are conflicts, which can be very annoying.
