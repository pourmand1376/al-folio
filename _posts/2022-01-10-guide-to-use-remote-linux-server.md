Well, you have got a server (most probably linux) which you want to run your tasks on it. How should you do that and What technologies you should adopt?

### Windows Users
This tutorial is written with bash (or zsh) in mind. So, If you are a mac or linux user, your default shell would be enough and you can go ahead with the rest of tutorial.

However, Windows users need to follow [this tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-11-with-gui-support#1-overview) to install `WSL` and then `Ubuntu` to get a good `bash`. After that you would install [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701) and you are good to follow this tutorial.

> Note: Some people use putty to connect to their linux box. I do not like it and I do not recommend it. That's very old school. 

## SSH
First of all, you know that you should connect to server via `SSH`: (1914 is just a dummpy number for port. Just select something that linux hasn't used)

    ssh -L 1914:localhost:1914 pourmand@ServerAddress

After that you will need to enter your password for the user `pourmand` in the server. 

### Connecting Without Password

You may want the server to **know** your computer i.e. it does not ask for password every time you want to connect to it.

First, create an ssh key on your machine: 
```shell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Second, you should add that ssh key to your ssh agent: 

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 # change this filename if anything else
```

Third, you should add your **public key** to your server, this way the server will know you! 

```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub username@serverip
```

You are done for this part. The server would not ask for your password ever again. 

If you want to know more deeply about how and why these commands work, I suggest that you read [this](https://linuxhandbook.com/add-ssh-public-key-to-server/) and [this](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) .

### Connecting with Only Server Name

In addition, you can also define your ssh servers in a file called `config`. This way you can forget the long command I told you at the beginning and connect to the server just by typing:

```bash
ssh my_server
```

For that, open `~/.ssh/config` file and write the following configuration:

```bash
HOST <<your_desired_host_name>>
	HOSTNAME <<hostname_ip>>
	USER <<your_username>>
	LOCALFORWARD 1717 localhost:1717
```

You can also set `tmux` to open automatically by adding the following lines ([Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27613209/how-to-automatically-start-tmux-on-ssh-session)) :

```bash
    RequestTTY yes 
    RemoteCommand tmux new -A -s <<your_tmux_session_name>>
```

Normally, I create two ssh hosts with different names. First one connects normally to the server and the second one directly connects to a tmux session. An Example would be:

```bash
HOST company
    HOSTNAME 21.23.18.21
    USER pourmand
    LOCALFORWARD 6006 localhost:6006
    
HOST company_a
    HOSTNAME 21.23.18.21
    USER pourmand
    RequestTTY yes
    RemoteCommand tmux new -A -s yolo
    LOCALFORWARD 6006 localhost:6006
```

## Tmux

Then you can run your commands on the server, e.g.:

    python train.py ...

This is especially good for commands that do not take long time to run. If you have a model that need to be trained for days or even longer, you can not use this. That's because the moment you close your `ssh`, all your normal processes would die. So, you will need to use a [terminal multiplexer](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/List_of_applications#Terminal_multiplexers) like [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) or `screen` to handle this problem. Both of them are free and open source and both have easy commands to achieve your needs. You can read full pros and cons [here](https://superuser.com/questions/236158/tmux-vs-screen). I use `tmux` because the syntax is easier to use.

Here is a simple tmux session I have created. Note that the session has 6 open tabs. Each of them may do something different.

> If you install tmux, out of the box, it won't look like this. You have to install [Oh-my-tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux) to make it look pretty. It is pretty easy to install. Just copy the lines and you're set. 

## Bash, Zsh

Also, if you are using `bash`, I recommend installing [Oh-my-bash](https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash) and if you are working with `zsh`, I recommend installing [Oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh). Actually, we live in the terminal. It shouldn't look like 80's anymore. It should look pretty.

## Miniconda 

Then, you want to install python packages in your environment. But hold on. You can not and should not install them system-wide. This is because multiple projects would require different versions of packages. They may even require different python versions other than preinstalled ones. We need a solution to handle all of them. 

`Miniconda` in my opinion is a very good solution to all of these problems. You can install it using [this guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html). Once installed, you basically need these commands. 

```bash
# create a new env
conda create -n venv

# create a new env with specified python version
conda create -n venv python=3.8

# to activate the env
conda activate venv
```

Now for package installation, you can use both `conda install` and `pip install`. Some people say that you shouldn't use both of them because it may cause problems. I just tend to use conda for creating and activating environment. Then, installing everything else with `pip` and that works just fine.

## Htop

I can't think anyone not using this tool. It shows you all processes and their memory usuage and what not. 

{% include figure.html path="assets/posts/remote_server/htop.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

## Nvidia-htop

You can see GPU information using `nvidia-smi`. But most of the time, it doesn't tell you all the information you need at once. You want to undestand who is using GPU or how much time GPU is being used and what not. You can see all you need using `nvidia-htop`. For installation, it is indeed very easy. 

```bash
pip install nvidia-htop

# then run
nvidia-htop.py
```

Usually, I use this command most of the time. So, I have a created an alias for it.

```bash
echo "alias nv='nvidia-htop.py'" >> ~/.profile

# use this if you do not already have .profile in your .bashrc and .zshrc
# this is very common
echo "source ~/.profile" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "source ~/.profile" >> ~/.zshrc
```

{% include figure.html path="assets/posts/remote_server/nvidia-htop.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

> `nvidia-htop` only shows the current status of GPU. It may change in a few seconds. To monitor GPU status regularly use `watch nvidia-htop.py`. This way you don't have to constantly type `nvidia-htop` over and over again. 

## NVITop

This one is very similar with `nvidia-htop` but it shows more! 

{% include figure.html path="assets/posts/remote_server/nvitop.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

Installation is also very easy:
```bash
pip install nvitop

# then run
nvitop
```
