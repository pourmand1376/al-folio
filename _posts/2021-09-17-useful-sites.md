These are primarily bookmarks I have in my browser. I thought they could be helpful to others, so I compiled them here.

## For Researchers


[Connected Papers](http://connectedpapers.com "Connected Papers")

This is an excellent tool for researchers, especially when searching for review articles. Enter the paper title, and you'll be able to see a beautiful graph of connected papers, as the name suggests!

[Research Rabbit](https://researchrabbitapp.com/)

I have always wanted a tool to find related papers to the ones I am already reading. This one does that. So, you don't need to search for the state of the art papers using different keywords now and then.

[Find Conferences, Journals, Workshops, Meetings, Symposiums, Seminars and other Events at Resurchify | Find Events Near Me!](https://www.resurchify.com/)

This one find important events as the name suggests. 

[MathPix](https://mathpix.com/)

This powerful program converts math formulas in Image or PDF to Latex.


[Online Mathematics Editor](https://www.mathcha.io/)

A fast way to write and share mathematics, especially when you don't have access to LATEX. Also, whenever I need to write some formulas, I first come here and write them, then export them into LATEX. It is a lot easier.

[Mermail Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/)

The best tool (language) for drawing a diagram is Mermaid. You don't have to use a mouse anymore. Just describe what you want, and it will render a beautiful diagram. This is also supported in GitHub markdown.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

Also, when creating more complex layouts that can not be defined easily via Mermaid, I have this one in mind. 

[Journal and Conference Ranking](https://www.resurchify.com/)


## Text Editing and paraphrasing tools

[Grammarly](grammarly.com)

Who doesn't know about Grammarly? It has become a de facto standard when checking grammar. However, what it does is very simple. Often I find it boring since It can not rephrase the whole sentence. I had an educational premium account, but I don't use it anymore. 

[WordTune](https://www.wordtune.com/)

It paraphrases my sentences into better ones, and I found this one very intelligent too.

[QuillBot](https://quillbot.com/)

This one is pretty interesting too. It offers unlimited free paraphrasing, so I use this one more than Wordtune. 

## Other Tools

[TIME.IS](https://time.is/)Â 
Exact time for any time zone

[Advanced Photo Editor](https://photopea.com)

Photoshop-like software for editing purposes. It is a fantastic alternative for someone like me who, you know, edits photos once a year! If you want something to use daily, I recommend [Krita](https://krita.org/en/).

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

You can call any API with Postman.

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)

[JSON Crack](https://jsoncrack.com/)

Seamlessly visualize your JSON data instantly into graphs!

[A great tool to flash ISO to USB](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)

Also, for windows, you can use [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/). I prefer to use [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) as it simultaneously supports multiple iso files.

[Clipboard Service](https://fastbin.xyz/)
[Online Clipboard Sharing](https://regprime.com/Clipboard)

Just another clipboard service that I use

[Real-time codesharing platform](https://codeshare.io/)

Here I can share my code in real-time! This is also good as a clipboard-sharing platform!

[The official list of applications - ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/List_of_applications)

[AUR packages for Arch Linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/)

If you are familiar with Arch Linux, you know these two are the only sites you need to install any software!

[Chaotic AUR](https://pkgs.org/)

A Useful site that provides compiled files to quickly install a package

[SpeedTest](https://www.speedtest.net/)

A good website which I use from time to time to check my internet connection. 

[Git Command Explorer](https://gitexplorer.com/)

Find the right commands you need without digging through the web.

## ML learning 

[Distill.pub](https://distill.pub/)

Machine Learning researchers should check out this site. There's no better explanation than what its creators say, "[Distill](https://distill.pub/) is dedicated to clear explanations of machine learning."

[ML Story](https://mlstory.org/)

This is an intuitive explanation of Machine learning, for starters.
